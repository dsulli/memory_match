<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>
    League of Matching plays like a standard memory match game: flip over two cards at a time and try
    to match them each turn. The unique part of this game is that you have a health bar:
</p>
<div id="hp-container">
    <div id="hp-bar"></div>
    <div id="hp-count">1000/1000</div>
</div>

<p>
    You start out at 1000 HP and lose 100 HP on each turn you mismatch cards. If you reach 0 HP, it's
    game over. However, you can buy items to
    help you. You start out with 300 gold, and can earn 300 more gold each time you make a match.
</p>
<div class="gold gold-prev">
    <img src="images/coins.png" alt="gold icon">
    <span id="total-gold-prev">300</span>
</div>
<p>
    Items can boost your health, reduce the HP you lose on mismatch, help you earn gold, and even give
    you a chance to make a match on the first card you flip! You can view the description of what each
    item does by hovering over the item icons or by clicking on the items link at the top of the page.
    The gold cost of the item is right below the item's icon.
