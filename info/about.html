 <h2>About the Game</h2>

    <p>
        This memory matching game is a way for me to practice and demonstrate my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    I've drawn a lot of League of Legends fan art throughout the years, so I figured I would make it the theme of this game.

        I designed, drew, and coded everything. I used Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for the UI and Paint Tool SAI for the artwork.
