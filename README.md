# Memory Match: League of Matching

[Live Demo](http://dsulli.github.io/memory_match/)

League of Matching is a memory match game featuring champions and items from League of Legends. This memory matching game was a way for me to practice and demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I designed, drew, and coded everything. I used Adobe Photoshop for the UI and Paint Tool SAI for the artwork. 

## Features
- Custom UI design & artwork
- Randomized cards
- Gold and item system
- Animations
- Win/Lose conditions
